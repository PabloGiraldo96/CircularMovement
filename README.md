*Introduction of deforming a plane using the sin function to recreate a sin wave and change the shape ocean waves..* 

# Explanation 

I took a flat grid surface divided into 70 / 70 tiles. 
Then I started to apply some sine functions to deform this grid surface. 
This type of wave follows the MAS (Armonic Simple Movement), which describes a periodic elongation of a particle as a function of time.

The mathematics behind this is a fundamental of trigonometry, also calculus. These principles are applied to fields such as electronics, map textures for video games, signal analysis and many others. 
What I found most incredible is the fact that these sinusoidal functions are on nature itself with the sound passing through the air, any movement that you can see on the water or, even when its a really hot day and you can see the distortion on long distances; these changes are called termic radiation and are electromagnetic waves behind it that change the current temperature.
